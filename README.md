# Personal Portfolio & Blog

A modern portfolio and blog website built with Astro, React, and styled-components. This project serves as both a showcase for my work and a platform for sharing technical insights through blog posts.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # React and Astro components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/        # Blog posts and portfolio data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ consts/         # Global consts for components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/        # Page layouts and templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/            # Utility functions and API clients
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/          # Route pages
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/         # Global styles and theme
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```
