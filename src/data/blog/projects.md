Unfortunately, i am not very diligent about following through on interesting or entrigueing ideas, and even worse at documenting them when they come to mind. Which is why i want to keep track of them in case i ever find the time or motivation to tackle some of them.

So here is the (hopefully) not-so-final list of project ideas i have.

## Web dev

- Page burn effect for image state changes

- Page that shows what percentage of the worlds population lives north/east/south/west of any given longitude/altitude

- Take image and draw triangles over it until a certain number of triangles is reached

- Git repo visualization for react apps

- POE regex builder

## App dev

- weather app for Berlin area using Deutschwer Wetterdienst data

- safe area example screen (for debugging difficult env(--safe-area-inset-X) interactions)

- music player with audio visualization
